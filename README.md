# EasterEggCodeHunt
This is a Simple OpenSource Website for an Easter Egg Code Hunt. 
The Basic Idea is to embedd a link in any file's meta data (Stegnography) or Simply Hide the Code in any Social Media Post with very low opacity. (Psuedo-Stegnigraphy)
A Code Hunt is conducted then and rules are dynamic, can be changed as per requirements.
Those who find the link, open it, tag a particular account with his Id Generated (From the Site) gets a swag or goodie or shoutout of some sort.
Feel free to Modify, Edit and Change any aspect of the code.
